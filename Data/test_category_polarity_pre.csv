14,276229,"- The breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit (in a generous portion). Sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious.- The location is midway between the beach and the old town, which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10-15 minutes (the owner lend us the bikes for free!). It is also just beside the rice fields, so you can take a small walk and admire the beautiful landscape. There are also minimarket/restaurants/pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need.- The best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity. She also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around Hoi An. When we come back to Hoi An (which we will do for sure!), we will definitely be staying here again. Everything was amazing, and for the price we paid we would even say it exceeded our expectations!","the breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit",service,positive

40,273490,"We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances.",very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom,facility,positive

The hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores, grocery and attractions. The nearest attraction can only be walked less that 1 kilometer which is the St Joseph Cathedral and the farthest would be 3 kilometers. We also like the Wifi connection it’s very fast. We like the big window facing the city view. We also like the put “don’t disturb” or “clean” sign that you can show outside your door. The receptionist was accommodating and nice. The safety box was not working. So we had to always secure our valuables ourselves. There was unpleasant smell in the room. It seems like smoke from outside gets inside our room even if window is closed and especially the AC is turned on you can still smell it.

I booked the first portion of our stay on booking. com at a discounted rate. The cost for 3 nights pre booked was the same cost as a 1 night extension that was booked at the hostel. I understand that it may be due to seasonal times of the year with tourism influx but just a heads up - if you know a rough plan of your trip it will save you to pre book on here!,the breakfast was tasty as well and reasonably priced,service,positive

489,271365,"Large room with huge bed. Mattresses are very firm as is common across SE Asia. Air conditioner so no problems staying cool when needed. Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish/crabs/etc to explore. The resort is extremely quiet, which is what we were looking for. Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John's tours, scooter rental, airport shuttles, and we extended our trip 2 days. They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Tet. Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door - as it was a slow period we were the only ones for most of our stay and only heard neighbors a few times.

It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC.

The room is also cleaned everyday to a high standard. The pool area is well maintained with lots of beds but never too crowded. The sun hits the pool all day and you get an incredible view of the sunset whilst you swim overlooking the rice fields. The breakfast was also great, lots of choice, freshly prepared food and super clean! Although a walk away from old town, the hotel has a free shuttle and provides free bicycles. The staff were so lovely and helpful, they got us extra pillows on request, set up the hotel computer for us and gave us a goodbye gift for our extended stay and a free airport transfer.

The bedroom is confortable, the bed I slept is so well and it's so comfy. They provide what you need for the beauty products or sanitary at the lobby ground floor for you, so you can take into your room. The decoration of the hotel is beautiful and modern but with warm and bright colours.

For example, one of our members starting to throw up during the trek and unfortunately was unable to continue.

The view from the room was amazing-rice field upon rice field. The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with mosquito nets. The food was incredible, some of the best we’ve eaten in Vietnam (so fresh). The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall. We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought. We (three 21 year old students) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on.

The bed is comfortable, the shower is just the right pressure and temperature, and the TV has options of Netflix and TV casting - everything is basically perfect! I really loved how the staff went above and beyond and helped me book deliveries and transportation! Big shoutout to Ms. Rosie and Jane for helping me and making my stay in Hanoi one to remember. They're amazing and you can tell they enjoy helping people out! At night, the alleyways are poorly lit so I prefer to go earlier back to the hotel for safety's sake.

I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip.","pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable",facility,positive

1924,272373,loved this hotel. we had a room with a little balcony overlooking the street. it has very good double glazing though so it wasn’t too noisy even though the location is in the heart of old town and 2 minutes from the lake. the itself room was stylishly decorated and really comfortable with a good shower. the staff were also excellent and really friendly. the only downside was that the breakfast was absolutely disgusting. I dare you to order their French toast.,we had a room with a little balcony overlooking the street,facility,positive

The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa.

2159,275391,"Amazing hotel right in the center of HCM city, perfect for a stay to visit and explore the city. Compact, yet the building is a beautifully designed oasis in the middle of the chaos of the city. The rooms and common areas are beautiful, the lobby lounge is a lovely cozy area to chill with a cup of coffee or tea. I saw some comments about the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee, so did not mind it at all. There is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym, did not use but looks great. Highly recommended and will definitely go back. Wonderful to go back to the calm, cool oasis after a crazy day out in the city1 Nothing!

The owners also helped us organise renting bicycles and scooter and offered to look after our luggage when she found out we had an evening transport time. Overall 10/10 for us.

Restaurant staff extremely friendly. - Adding to the fact that it is new, everything is nice and clean. Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city, it just felt like a breath of fresh air, since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic, the heat, the trash and vermin, our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax. - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude. Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome. Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street, and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong. The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3-day Halong Bay Cruise, helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone. - There were still constructions going on in the hotel (like the sky bar and spa were not yet ready during our stay). - Walls of the room are not really sound proof, you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds, but this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research. - The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep, (my husband's side was not affected as much), we could not switch it off because it was quite hot in Hanoi when we were there, but the room is quite small (as always, it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter), so there is literally no where else they can put the vent.",trendy decorations and good ambiance,facility,positive

3510,272245,We had such a brilliant time staying in Chapi Dreamy Home. It was away from the centre of Sapa town which we were delighted with as it felt more authentic.

We were made delicious breakfast and dinners on both days. The little girl was a delight to be around. We loved spending time in this home away from home. Mai the owner was extremely helpful in organising tours via text (she was away due to New Year) She went above and beyond to help us. The tours we booked through her were excellent.

4036,273510,"Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access.","nice looking room, spacious with a bath",facility,positive

The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home.

4101,270187,"This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff.

We booked 2 rooms and both were extremely dirty and many things were broken. Furthermore, it’s stated on the internet as a 4 star hotel but it is a betray. When asking the receptionist, he said it’s 3 star and they’re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future. This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too. When arriving, the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view. But that’s not what we booked. So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty. Fatty fingerprints everywhere, dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months. We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn’t sleep the whole night. After addressing these issues to the hotelier he was very rude and still wanted to charge us. It took us half a day to find a new hotel and to discuss those problems and our holidays were ruined.

The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station.

4618,276238,"The hostel is in a fantastic location, very central but quiet as it located down a long alleyway. The hosts do not speak much english but they are friendly and provide you with all the information you need upon check-in. The cubes are vary spacious and spotless, as are the facilities. Clean towels, face towels, toothbrushes and indoor shoes are readily available.

5278,274961,Firstly the staff here is superb. They were all so polite and helpful and equally attentive to everyone. I have never experienced such excellent service before. I visited Vietnam 3 years ago and did not have a pleasant experience with one of the hotel. Since then I was wary of coming back here. I am glad to say that Sun river staff changed my attitude towards Vietnam and I am so glad I came back and I now have happy memories of this country. They also offered us free breakfast for our entire stay in celebration of reopening after covid. The rooms were squeaky clean and well equipped. The location is central with many eateries and cafes nearby as well as the My Khe beach. Grab food is delivered here at whichever time of the night you want it.

5288,276287,"Nice breakfast. The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website. To be fair this is not my kind of hotel. This is my 8th trip to Vietnam. This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way. My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos. The hotel was very tired. My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock (the sliding window was too big for the space). The room was dark 24/7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well. The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters. There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills, jackhammers etc from 7. 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay. My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light. We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we'd paid way too much. The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central. Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1. As a note the regular guy on the egg station appeared to me to be up himself - there was a trainee guy working with him from one of the universities who was absolutely delightful and friendly who was trying very hard but was very nervous - the supervisor was a rude a..... to him - as a mum I really wanted to give him a hug and say it will get better - keep going young man you have a great personality that will take you far.

5753,271978,Beds were comfortable. Room was immaculate. View was spectacular. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Breakfast buffet was delicious. We had an amazing time and will absolutely return again and stay here. We especially felt welcomed by the hotel staff member named Tran. She was so friendly and offered us advice on where to go. She also helped us when my friend was injured on his motorcycle when a woman ran into him and cut his leg. Tran helped clean and dress the wound. No shelf on wall in standing shower to put your soap and shampoo / shavers. Only 2 lifts in building to service 20 floors. We spent much time standing waiting for the lifts.

They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests.

The family running this homestay is so helpful in arranging trips, explaining the ins and outs of Hoi An and would even go so far as to lend me money when my card wasnˋt working for a day. I was able to rent a free bike to roam around town and cycle to the beach and was even offered free food upon arrival and when I had to depart super early. You shouldnˋt miss their breakfast as it’s delicious and I can recommend just hanging out with them to learn more about Vietnamese life. I’d go back in a heart beat and can only hope for you to do the same.","the family running this homestay is so helpful in arranging trips, explaining the ins and outs of hoi an and would even go so far as to lend me money when my card wasnˋt working for a day",service,positive

My wife and I we like to hike and after a long 8-10 km hike laying down on a soft bed gave us backache and neck ache. I believe for a public places like hotels firm beds are best choices.

Let me tell you everything you have to know about it. 1/ Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam . I arrived at night so I could not see the landscape but when I woke up and look throw the window I was shocked about how beautiful the place was. The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life.", this place looks like paradise on earth,experience,positive

7800,276066,"We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang. I believe they have four rooms at the property, three of them in one building, and a fourth right next door (the Ground Floor Room). We stayed in the Ground Floor Room, which may have some differences from the other three. We were very happy with the room. It is spacious, the bed is comfortable, and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices. The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia, and very stable temperature control. The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld. There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop, and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee. The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon. It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral. The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi, who dropped us at the cathedral. Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building. This alley also has a dessert shop (Mlem Pudding) right across from the Bare Han building, and a coffee shop. The location is excellent, with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left. There are several coffee shops in the area. We recommend An Le Cafe if you don't mind sitting outdoors with a fan (“Anle Cafe” on Google Maps). If you want air conditioning, Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block. If you need to do laundry while you are here, we took ours to “Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan. This particular room only had two drawbacks, that were not really a problem for us. The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away. They have put plants in the space, as well as lights, which is a nice solution, but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door. The room itself has plenty of artificial light, though. I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley, but I'm not sure. The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors. You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy, but they are not fully opaque. The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls.",we had a great stay at bare han during our four nights in da nang,experience,positive

It is spacious, the bed is comfortable, and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices. The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia, and very stable temperature control. The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld. There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop, and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee. The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon. It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral. The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi, who dropped us at the cathedral. Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building. This alley also has a dessert shop (Mlem Pudding) right across from the Bare Han building, and a coffee shop. The location is excellent, with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left. There are several coffee shops in the area. We recommend An Le Cafe if you don't mind sitting outdoors with a fan (“Anle Cafe” on Google Maps). If you want air conditioning, Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block. If you need to do laundry while you are here, we took ours to “Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan. This particular room only had two drawbacks, that were not really a problem for us. The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away. They have put plants in the space, as well as lights, which is a nice solution, but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door. The room itself has plenty of artificial light, though. I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley, but I'm not sure. The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors. You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy, but they are not fully opaque. The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls.",the location is excellent,amenity,positive

8365,273149,"The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes.

Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too.
